Playground allow you to write Lobe compatible MDX that renders only on the client.In some instances where remote loading MDX is not an option, this may work as a great alternative.

Here's an example of a Callout.

<Callout type={'info'}>
  A callout is a short piece of text intended to attract attention.
</Callout>

Check out the [Built-ins Mdx Components](https://ui.lobehub.com/components/mdx/callout) for more information.
